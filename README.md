A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model used for image classification. It extracts spatial features using convolution and pooling layers, flattens the output, and classifies using dense layers. This binary CNN model differentiates between cats and dogs, utilizing ReLU activations, max pooling, and a sigmoid output layer.
